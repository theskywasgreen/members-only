# Members Only - ClubHouse
A web app created using Ruby on Rails and Bootstrap that allows users to sign up and post embarassing stories. Being signed up also allows the user to see who else has written embarassing posts. If a user is not signed up the user may read the posts but cannot see the name of the user who has written the post. 

This is a project from [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/home) curriculum.
